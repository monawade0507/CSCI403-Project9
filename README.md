# CSCI403-Project9
This is a fairly open-ended assignment. Ideally I want you to find an interesting dataset and do something creative and new with it. One possibility is to find one or more additional datasets that intersect with your original dataset in some interesting fashion, and do a "query mashup" with the datasets.
